# EmotiBot-A-Multimodal-Emotion-Aware-Chatbot
EmotiBot is a hybrid deep learning project that combines classical NLP and modern transformer-based models to create an empathetic, context-aware chatbot. The system detects user emotions from both text and images and generates tailored responses that adapt to the detected mood.

The architecture integrates a BiLSTM model for fine-grained emotion classification, a LoRA-finetuned Flan-T5 model for response generation, and CLIP/ViT models for image-based emotion detection. By fusing these components, EmotiBot demonstrates the power of combining deep learning, transformers, and multimodal learning in conversational AI.
